# Hello and Welcome! 🚀

## About Me

- 💻 I work as a software engineer at [@FSU Facilities](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fsu-facilities/), specializing in Full Stack Web, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning.
- 🎓 I graduated with my degree in Computer Science from Florida State University in 2024.
- 😄 When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me cooking, dancing, or working on Adobe illustrations!
- 🎧 I’m a podcast enthusiast and enjoy a wide range of topics such as tech, entrepreneurship, philosophy, and music.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m preparing for Kubernetes certification, and I aim to complete it by the end of the year.
- 🕺🏻 Fun fact: I challenge myself to learn a new choreography every week!

In my work and life, I believe in the philosophy of Bruce Lee: "Flow like water." This mindset helps me adapt, innovate, and keep pushing forward.
