- 🎓 I graduated with my degree in Computer Science from Florida State University in 2024.
- 😄 When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me cooking, dancing, or working on Adobe illustrations!

- 🌱 Currently, I’m preparing for Kubernetes certification, and I aim to complete it by the end of the year.
- 🕺🏻 Fun fact: I challenge myself to learn a new choreography every week!
- 🙏🏻 Myth: I believe in the philosophy of Bruce Lee [Be like Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ) This mindset helps me adapt, innovate, and keep pushing forward.
